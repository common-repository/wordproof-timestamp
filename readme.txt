Timestamp your WordPress content on the blockchain for protection and trust. No blockchain knowledge required.

== Description ==

### WordProof: Timestamp your WordPress Content on the Blockchain

With WordProof Timestamp, you can timestamp your WordPress content on any EOSIO blockchain from the comfort of your WordPress site. No prior blockchain experience necessary. After the set-up, everything is taken care of automatically!

### Why do I need to timestamp my content?

WordProof Timestamp does everything in its power to bring the benefits of blockchain to your WordPress website. Here are some reasons why you should timestamp your content:

- Copyright protection
- Transparency: increase trust and claim authenticity
- Next-generation SEO benefits
- Proof of existence at certain moments in time
- Prepare for upcoming EU regulations
- Be your own notary

### Features

- Automatically timestamp your content on the blockchain
- Show the blockchain certificate pop-up on your website
- Let your visitors verify when and how your content changed
- Downloadable blockchain certificate as proof of existence

### How does WordProof Timestamp work?

Timestamping creates a unique and universal fingerprint (the 'hash') for all your posts, pages and media files. If the input changes, the hash becomes totally different.

This hash is added to the blockchain with a date and time. Because you (the website owner) have the input that results in this specific hash, you can prove that you published the content at that point in time.
